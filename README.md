My capstone project at the end of data Engineering using Python &amp; MySQL as case study.
I converted the .mdb files to a .xlsx file with the help of the microsoft access 2016 and later coverted the .xlsx file from microsoft excel to a .csv file.
I imported the .csv file to MySQL Workbench database where I selected the columns I needed for the task, so that I can start querying the data and get the solution to the asked questions.
I later copy the .csv file to my DataFrame so I can know the length of data am working with.
"C:\Users\USER\Downloads\Capstone Project 3.ipynb" contains all my query for this project.
